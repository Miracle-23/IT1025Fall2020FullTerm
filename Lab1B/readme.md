# Executive summary
Type your executive summary as if you were explaining your lab on an IT team

# Information System Componentsâ€¯ 

* Take the example of ATM that we use everyday. Explain or identify what is the hardware, software, data, people and process in the system you identified with respect to the ATM.
  Some examples of the ATM we use everyday is the Card chip and Bar reader

# Github

* In GitHub you are experiencing a "Client-Server" architecture.  Explain what is meant by "client-server" architecture and how GitHub fits this model.
Client-Server is when a electronic device can connect and work within each other. GitHub fits well with this model because the professor and students can all use it at once.

* Why is GitHub considered "Cloud Computing?" What other "cloud computing" environments do you use?
GitHub is considered cloud computing because it is a website that can do a lot of things and it can be used on different devices. The other Cloud Computing I use is Microsoft Word.
# Conclusion
In this section you might discuss future considerations (what you might want to learn more about), issues that you encountered (remember you may decide to post your repo link on LinkedIn or provide to a future employer so be sure to keep your discussion professional) and/or your impressions of the lab components.
One of the issues in the lab component I encountered is the losing work and finding work in places I didn't keep it but the solution is that I have to troubleshoot because that is what Information Technology is all about.
